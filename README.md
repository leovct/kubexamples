# üèó Kubexamples
Simple examples of Kubernetes manifests - more practical than your post-its

## What's the point?

Do you often wonder how to create a pod, deployment, service or any other resource in Kubernetes? Me too. It takes several minutes or more to find a suitable manifest example, and most of the time, when deploying it, there is always a problem. With this website, you don't need to worry anymore, all the Kubernetes manifests you need are just a click away.

A similar project already exists under the name of [kubernetes-examples](https://github.com/ContainerSolutions/kubernetes-examples). Kubexamples aims to be an improved version, providing more examples and clear, simple and quality documentation to make your life easier.
